# Kirby Air Ride Gecko Codes
A collection of Gecko codes for the PAL version of Kirby Air Ride for the GameCube.

Some codes are from [Kirby Air Ride Online](https://github.com/EternalllZM/rtd-kar/) which were shared under the MIT license and are not by me. These are clearly noted.

Huge thanks to:
